# ING Machine Learning Case

This is the recruiting case for the RPAA team. Good luck & have fun!

## Use Case Description

The current lending manager responsible for personal loans at ING has engaged you to help improve the profitability of the loan portfolio.
His department has collected four datasets for you to use, detailed below.

### Assignment

Your goal as Data Scientist is to build a model that can help maximise the future profits. The modeling solution (definition of the problem, algorithms used, designs, etc.) is up to you.

> Should you have any questions concerning this case, we encourage you to reach out to Aydin Senaydin (aydin.senaydin@ing.com).

### Assessment

- Focus on solving a single modelling problem, otherwise the case would take too much time.
- Push your code to the master branch of your git repository.
- There will be a 30 minute presentation and ~30-45 minutes of Q&A. The storyline should be understandable for a 'lending manager' but deep dives on data science / machine learning are OK. There is no requirement for the form of your presentation (but PowerPoint is typical).
- Feel free reuse your own code from other projects, or reuse code from other sources.
- You can always spend more time building even better models. The case is intended to take ~8 hours. Let us know in the presentation which ideas you would pursue if you would have had more time to work on the project.
- Please submit code & presentation 24 hours before your interview so that we can review before the interview.

We will evaluate the quality of your code, your solution and how you present it to peers and business stakeholders.

## Quick primer on personal loans

Personal loans are financial products designed to provide financing to a customer. After a loan is given to a customer, they have to repay in monthly installments. 
A personal loan is profitable if the customer repays the installments.
If a customer defaults and the bank is not able to recover the lended money, it causes a loss to the bank (see details in the delinquencies section).

### Delinquencies

Loan delinquencies are defined as the number of installments not paid after the due date.
When the delinquency exceeds 3 months (=3 installments, 3 payments missed), the loan is defined as defaulted.

This is the legal definition of defaults. When this happens, the bank must report to the relevant authority the default of the customer. 

For the purposes of this case:

- The loan amount can be considered lost when a default occurs.
- For portfolio management only the first 12 installments can be considered. Delinquencies on later installments are not provided, and hence can be ignored.
